# Acoustic Recording Devices (ARD)

## Preamble

This pilot project will be proof of concept for a low cost bird monitoring program for conservation groups engaged in volunteer stewardship of natural areas in the GTA.

Natural areas and ravine. Many sites across the GTA; too many for City staff to restore and monitor.
Volunteers are being encouraged to adopt and restore pieces of the system. Toronto Nature Stewards Restoration sites.
In addition to restoration, Monitoring sites is important to assess progress and evaluate methods.
Bird monitoring can be a part of this in addition to plant monitoring. Birds can tell us a lot. 
Birds should be monitored at these sites in the migration periods (may, October), and in summer (resident breeding).
Migrant periods are especially challenging to monitor for a number of reasons. Peak lasts about 3 weeks, bird ID requires expert birders. Given the number of potential restoration sites, it is not practical to expect to deploy birders on the ground at all sites. 
The summer period is longer, and resident birds are less challenging. The restoration volunteers can assess breeding birds quite well.
Audio recording devices that record bird sounds could be used in migration periods at restoration sites as a monitoring tool. Analysis of the files could be conducted using software and volunteer experts.
These volunteer restoration  groups have zero budgets for the most part, and so they would need a low cost way to install, deploy, and analyse these audio data as part of the bird monitoring.
