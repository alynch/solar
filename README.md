# Acoustic Recording Devices (ARD)

## Preamble

This pilot project will be proof of concept for a relatively simple, economical bird monitoring program for conservation groups 
engaged in volunteer stewardship of natural areas in the GTA. 
There are potentially dozens of these projects across the City, so the program has to scale.

The GTA has many parks and natural areas, managed by the City and by TRCA. 
Most of these natural areas have become degraded, especially over the last 30 years, from a variety of factors including human disturbance.

The task of rehabilitating these areas is too large for staff alone.
However, there are citizen groups that have been,or want to be, volunteering to restore these sites across the city.
Groups such as Toronto Nature Stewards are now training citizens to lead stewardship efforts in their local neighbourhoods.

One aspect of a restoration project is tracking the impacts, and evaluating the successes.
In addition to plant monitoring, bird monitoring can be a useful tool at restoration sites.
Bird species diversity and abundance can tell us a lot about the state of a natural area.

The bird composition of Toronto changes seasonally, and so to comprehensively monitor how birds are using the restoration site habitats, requires several survey efforts.
The two main periods are the spring migration in May, and the summer breeding season in June and July.

There should be bird surveys in May and in October, during the spring and fall migration periods when many birds stop over in the City to refuel before continuing north to their summer habitat or south to their wintering habitat.
These counts are especially challenging because many of the migrants are warblers which are difficult to identify in the field, especially for casual birders.
Surveys of the summer residents are less challenging, and can be conducted by the volunteer stewards when they are on site.

Audio recording devices could be used in migration periods at restoration sites as a bird monitoring tool. 
They are now widely used, mostly in remote locations.
Analysis of the files could be conducted using software and volunteer experts.

Urban environments pose some significant risks from vandalism, so there would be some special requirements for the deployment.


The volunteer stewardship groups typically have small (zero?) budgets for the most part, and so they would need a low cost way to install, deploy, and analyse these audio data as part of the bird monitoring.
