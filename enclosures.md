# Enclosures


We need an enclosure that can house at a minimum a Raspberry Pi (65 x 30 mm for a Zero or a Zero 2), a battery (varying sizes, but at least 60 x 120 mm),
 and associated cables.

1554 series
Alej  got flat lid style 1554-VAL2GY. Similar sized models: 1554VAGY, 1554VGY

The 1555 series is a flanged lid that looks promising except that they don’t do a large version. So suggest that we look at “feet” for the 1554 series.

Accessories
There is a “foot kit” accessory which can help wall mount. 
Part No: 1554FT. (set of 4). Ordered from Sayal

## Cases and Dry Boxes

Quebec company, about $70, but sturdy. Wondering if squirrels and racoons might be a problem with simpler types.
