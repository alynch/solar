## Access Point notes

We need a device that can work as a wireless access point. Ideally we can flush
the firmware so that we can install a custom linux firmware.

There are several linux-based systems tat we could use: Tomato-RT, DD-wrt,
OpenWrt. OpenWrt seems to be the most flexible, and therefore it's the system
we are using.

We need to use hardware that is compatible with OpenWrt (supported chip, enough
flash memory, etc) and that has the capability to accept external storage (via
USB, Compact Flash, etc.).

We have used the NetgearN600 Wireless Router. I has to be Model WNDR3700 v1 or
v2; all other models seem to be unsupported.

This seems to be a reliable and powerful model: Atheros AR7161 680 MHz MIPS
32-bit processor, 8 MB flash and 64 MB RAM. Wi-Fi specs include a 2.4 GHz
Atheros AR9223 2x2 MIMO radio and a 5 GHz Atheros AR9220 2x2 MIMO radio.

Other supported models are:
 * Linksys WRT54GL
 * TP-Link TL-WR1043ND
